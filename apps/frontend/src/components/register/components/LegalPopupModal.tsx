        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm">
          <p>
            <strong>8.1</strong> We retain your personal data only for as long as your account
            remains active or as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected,
            including compliance with legal, accounting, and regulatory obligations, this Privacy
            policy and the T&Cs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>8.2</strong> When determining the appropriate retention period for personal
            data, we consider several factors, including the type of data being processed, the
            potential risk of harm from unauthorized disclosure, the purpose of processing, and
            whether the intended outcome can be achieved through alternative means without
            processing the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>8.3</strong> Once your personal data is no longer required for the purposes
            outlined in this Privacy policy, we will delete it from our systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>8.4</strong> Where possible, we will also delete your personal data upon
            request, as described in Section 10 of this Privacy policy.

            govern the privacy practices of such third-party websites. We strongly encourage you to

          <p>
            <strong>10.1</strong> Subject to local laws, applicable legal requirements, and
            exemptions, you have certain rights concerning your personal data, including:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.1.1</strong> Right of access: You have the right to request information about
            the personal data we hold about you, how it is used, and to obtain a copy of such data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.1.2</strong> Right of rectification: You have the right to correct any
            inaccurate or incomplete personal data concerning you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.1.3</strong> Right to erasure: You have the right to request the deletion of
            your personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.1.4</strong> Right to data portability: You have the right to receive the
            personal data you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable
            format and to transmit it to another data controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.1.5</strong> Right to object: You have the right to object to the processing
            of your personal data where it is based on our legitimate interests or the public
            interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.1.6</strong> Right to restrict processing: In certain cases, you have the
            right to request that we limit the processing of your personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.1.7</strong> Right to file a complaint: You have the right to lodge a
            complaint with your local data protection authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.2</strong> If we process your personal data based on your consent, you have
            the right to withdraw that consent at any time with future eIect. Please note that
            withdrawing consent may result in the inability to use certain functionalities on the
            Platform or, in some cases, access the Platform altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.3</strong> To exercise the rights under this section you have to contact our
            support team. We will respond to your request within three (3) months. Before processing
            any access or deletion request, we will take appropriate steps to verify your identity
            and confirm your right to access or delete the requested data. This security measure
            ensures that personal data is not disclosed to unauthorized persons or deleted in an
            improper manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10.4</strong> Certain requests to delete specific personal data may require the
            deletion of your entire user account, as maintaining a user account is inherently linked
            to the processing of certain personal information. If you choose to delete your account,
            all associated data—including, but not limited to, user profile details, shared content,
            and any other account-specific data—will no longer be accessible. If, after deleting
            your account, you wish to create a new one in the future, you will need to register
            again, as no previously stored data will be recoverable.
