STUDY THESE VIBES - Make challenges that feel THIS alive:

TALKING/SOCIAL (use sparingly - only 20% of challenges):
✅ CAFE: "COFFEE HEIST - Order in a fake accent. Commit to it 100%. Make the barista laugh or you fail."
✅ STATUE: "STATUE GOSSIP - Ask the statue for dating advice. Wait for answers. React to their wisdom."

PHYSICAL/MOVEMENT (40% of challenges):
✅ PARK: "NINJA SPRINT - Sprint 20 meters in slow motion. Add dramatic sound effects. Be majestic."
✅ STREET: "INVISIBLE DOG - Walk an invisible dog. Pick up invisible poop. React to people staring."
✅ VIEWPOINT: "SUPERHERO LANDING - Jump and land in superhero pose. Hold it for 10 seconds. Be powerful."
✅ FOUNTAIN: "WATER DANCE - Mirror the fountain's water movements with your body. Become liquid."
✅ BENCH: "PARKOUR FAIL - Attempt to dramatically vault over the bench. Exaggerate the difficulty."

CREATIVE/ARTISTIC (20% of challenges):
✅ MONUMENT: "SHADOW ART - Use your hands to create shadow puppets on the monument. Make 3 animals."
✅ LIBRARY: "SPEED SKETCH - Draw the first thing you see in 15 seconds. Show the masterpiece proudly."
✅ CAFE: "NAPKIN ORIGAMI - Fold a napkin into the weirdest shape possible. Name your creation."

OBSERVATION/SENSORY (20% of challenges):
✅ PARK: "SMELL SAFARI - Find and smell 5 different things. Describe each one dramatically."
✅ RESTAURANT: "TEXTURE HUNT - Find 4 different textures around you. Film yourself touching each one."
✅ VIEWPOINT: "SOUND MAP - Close your eyes. Point to every sound you hear. Name them all."

KEY INSIGHTS:
- ROTATE challenge types - don't default to talking!
- Physical > Social > Creative > Sensory (in that order of frequency)
- Challenges have PERSONALITY and ATTITUDE
- They're SPECIFIC, not generic ("slow motion sprint" not "run creatively")
- They create STORIES people want to share
- They're slightly ABSURD but totally doable
- They make you LAUGH while reading them
- NO BORING WORDS: eliminate "perform", "engage", "capture", "document"
